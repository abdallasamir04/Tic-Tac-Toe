A classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented with a graphical user interface using **Python** and **Tkinter**.
Play against an AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels, enjoy various visual themes, and experience optional sound effects (requires Pygame).
This project was developed by **_Abdalla Samir_**.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Clean and intuitive interface built with Tkinter, featuring a 3x3 game grid and control buttons.
*   **Intelligent AI Opponent:** Play against an AI with three difficulty levels:
    *   **Easy:** Makes random valid moves.
    *   **Medium:** Blocks player wins, seeks its own wins, otherwise plays randomly or uses basic strategy.
    *   **Hard:** Implements the **Minimax algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning for optimal move selection.
*   **Customizable Themes:** Choose from six different visual themes (e.g., Sci-Fi, Retro, Forest, Dark Mode) to change the look and feel.
*   **Sound Effects:** Optional sound feedback for clicks, wins, and losses (requires Pygame installation).
*   **Player Options:** Select your preferred symbol (X or O) and choose whether to play first or second.
*   **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of wins for the Player, AI, and the number of Draw games.
*   **Game Controls:** Easily restart the game, change difficulty, switch themes, or exit the application.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Play

1.  **Launch:** Run the `main.py` script using Python.
2.  **Setup:** A setup window appears. Choose your symbol (X or O) and whether you want to play first or second. Click "Start Game".
3.  **Gameplay:**
    *   Click on an empty square in the 3x3 grid to place your symbol.
    *   The AI will automatically make its move after a short delay (on Medium/Hard difficulty).
    *   The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
    *   If all squares are filled and no one has won, the game is a draw.
4.  **Controls:**
    *   **Restart:** Click the "Restart" button to start a new game with the current settings and scores.
    *   **Difficulty:** Use the dropdown menu to select Easy, Medium, or Hard AI difficulty (restarts the game).
    *   **Theme:** Use the dropdown menu to change the visual theme instantly.
    *   **Exit:** Click the "Exit" button to close the application.
5.  **Scoreboard:** The scores for Player, Draws, and AI are displayed at the bottom.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

*   **GUI (`gui.py`):** Manages the main window, grid buttons, labels, control widgets, and user interactions using Tkinter. Handles the game loop visually.
*   **Game Logic (`game_logic.py`):** Contains functions for board initialization, checking for valid moves, determining win/draw conditions, and implementing the AI logic (random, basic strategy, Minimax).
*   **Theming (`themes.py`):** Defines color palettes for different UI elements in a dictionary structure. The GUI module reads and applies these themes.
*   **Sound (`gui.py` / Pygame):** Integrates with the Pygame library (if available) to load and play `.wav` sound effects triggered by game events.
*   **Main (`main.py`):** The entry point of the application, responsible for importing necessary modules and launching the `TicTacToeGUI`. Includes basic error handling for missing dependencies (like Pygame).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x installed.
    *   Tkinter (usually included with Python standard library).
2.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-link>
    cd TICTACTOEGAME
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Pygame is required for sound effects. If you want sound, install it:
        ```bash
        pip install pygame
        ```
    *   If you don't need sound, you can run the game, but you might see an error message in the console if Pygame isn't found (the game should still work visually).
4.  **Run the Game:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
