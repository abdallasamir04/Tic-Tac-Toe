**Tic-Tac-Toe Pro GUI** is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented with a graphical user interface using Python's **Tkinter** library.
It features an intelligent AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels, multiple visual themes, and optional sound effects (requires **Pygame**).
This project demonstrates GUI development, game logic implementation, and basic AI principles (Minimax). Developed by **_Abdalla Samir_**.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Clean GUI:** An intuitive and responsive graphical interface built with Tkinter, featuring a 3x3 game grid and control buttons.
*   **Intelligent AI Opponent:** Play against an AI with three difficulty settings:
    *   `Easy`: Makes random moves.
    *   `Medium`: Basic logic (tries to win, tries to block).
    *   `Hard`: Uses the **Minimax algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning for optimal play.
*   **Multiple Visual Themes:** Choose from **six** different themes (like Sci-Fi, Retro, Forest) to customize the game's appearance.
*   **Optional Sound Effects:** Get audio feedback for button clicks, wins, and losses (requires Pygame installation).
*   **Player Options:** Choose to play as 'X' or 'O' and decide whether to go first or second.
*   **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of wins for the Player, AI, and the number of draws during the current session.
*   **Restart Functionality:** Easily start a new game round without closing the application.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Initialization:** The application starts, sets up the main window, game board grid, control panel, and loads the default theme using `Tkinter`.
2.  **Game Setup:** A setup dialog prompts the player to choose their symbol (X/O) and turn order.
3.  **Player Turn:** The player clicks on an empty cell on the grid. The GUI captures the click event.
4.  **Game Logic Update:** The `gui.py` script updates the internal board representation in `game_logic.py` and visually updates the clicked button.
5.  **State Check:** `game_logic.py` checks if the player's move resulted in a win or a draw.
6.  **AI Turn (if applicable):** If the game continues, `gui.py` calls `game_logic.py`'s `ai_move` function.
7.  **AI Calculation:** Based on the selected difficulty, the AI determines its move (randomly for Easy, basic logic for Medium, Minimax for Hard).
8.  **GUI Update:** The AI's move is reflected on the GUI, and the game state is checked again (AI win or draw).
9.  **Theme Application:** The selected theme's colors are applied to all relevant GUI elements.
10. **Scoring:** Scores are updated after each game ends.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone : https://github.com/abdallasamir04/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
    cd TICTACTOEGAME
    ```
2.  **Ensure Python is installed.** (Developed with Python 3.x)
3.  **Install Pygame (for sound effects):**
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
    *Note: Tkinter usually comes built-in with Python.*
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
